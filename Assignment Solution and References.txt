Assignment :


1.a. The classification performed using Support Vector Classification to predict the grade of the property seems to be achievable.
We tried to evaluate the grade by removing it from the dataset and training a machine learning model to predict the grade from given
rest of the imput data .
I got the following metrics :
Classification model metrics : 
1.F1 score =  0.8548510797529696
2.Precision score =  0.8555864540847855
3.Recall score =  0.8544546850998463
4.Accuracy score =  0.8555555555555555

1.b.In the next part I tried if I can predict the house prices given the rest of the data. To me this seemed unachievable at the moment.
Maybe because the data was too much categorical and the no of training examples were very less. Also I dropped the description column which
contained really valuable information like View,Pool etc. . I think Natural Language Processig would have helped. The latitude and longitude 
values could have helped. Also a lot of features were very sparse it was quite tough to handle the missing data. Like we couldn't drop the train-
ing examples as they were already very less. The RMSE was much higher seems something or everything went wrong.
I got the following metrics for price prediction :
Regression Model Metrics : 
1.RMSE =  10799575.503082532


2.Programmed the machine learning model in python and uploaded to github repository

3.a. Some more data like the crime rate in that locality, average people's income , availability of hospital,schools,shooping complexes nearby ,road
and highway connectivity , airport distance etc would be much promising data to help evaluate the model more accurately.

3.b. If I get the data I would like to built it through a deep learning approach . As I mentioned earlier the description consisted very valuable
information which I did not take into account because of the extensive computation requirements . Natural Language Processing for such models can 
help upto a great extent.
